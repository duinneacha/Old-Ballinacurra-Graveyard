    <h3>Alko Mulder</h3>

        <div class="feature-text">
            <p>On November 14th 1947 a Dutch Vessel the MS Libelle sailed into Ballinacurra. Aboard was a 21-year-old Dutch sailor, Alko Mulder. At 8pm that evening he took a wrong turn on the pier when returning to the vessel and drowned.</p>

            <p>A surviving witness recalls the body of the sailor lying face down in the mud down the Quay on the morning of November 15th. The Gardaí suggested throwing a rope to catch the body to recover it but Sonny O'Mahony waded out in the mud and water and brought Alko Mulder's remains ashore.</p>

            <p>On the following evening, November 16th, an inquest was held in Midleton Courthouse under deputy Coroner William St. Clair Rice. The ship's engineer Nicholas Vink stated that the deceased sailor was a poor swimmer.</p>

            <p>Garda Sergeant Whelan told the jury that the quay was lighted by three oil lamps. In its judgement, the jury expressed the opinion that the lighting on the quay was totally inadequate and requested that the Cork Harbour Board attend to this.</p>

            <p>The MS Libelle left port on November 18th, bound for Weston Point UK, on the Manchester Canal, laden with 290 tonnes of Clay from the Cloyne Mineral Company.</p>

            <p>The people of Ballinacurra came together and buried Alko Mulder here, and made a little headstone for him, which was fitting of community spirit here when people didn't have much during post-war rationing. Future Dutch ships entering and exiting the Port of Ballinacurra following his death used to give a longhorn salute when passing Alko's resting place.</p>

            <p>Alko, a teetotal and never consumed alcohol, was a bachelor from Delfzijl, Holland and the son of Mulder Siebe and Havinga Zaantje. Five months later, on 26th April 1948, Mulder and Havinga were summoned to the town hall in Delfzijl and were informed of his death.</p>

            <p>The Dutch Embassy assisted us with our enquiries for further information, however, record-keeping was poor during and after the Second World War, so we were unable to get Alko's shipping records.</p>

            <p>Alko Mulder is buried behind the church, facing Ballyanan. His resting place was one of those recovered when our graveyard was reclaimed from nature. And now, he's been looked after again, with a clean resting place, and a modern headstone facing the path.</p>

            <p>Daragh Devlin miraculously tracked Alko's ancestors in Delfzjil.</p>

            <p>Ballinacurra 1947, photos of Alko Mulder's funeral were taken by the Cork Examiner for his family who couldn't make it. There is also a telegram of events of the day for our next snippet.</p>

            <p>The hearse we believe is from Hyde's. Walsh's we believe is 7 Main Street. The RIC barracks was closed by then so the Gardaí were from the Midleton Barracks.</p>

            <p>Please respect the history of these photos and not pawn them off as your own. We have permission to post these from his family.</p>

            <p>Can you identify anyone in the photos?</p>

        <div class="feature-text">
            <p>You may wonder what our hut was for as you enter the gate. This Hut measures approx 10ft x 6.5ft with a fireplace and the person in it watched for graverobbers. There are no other remains of watchman huts in other graveyards that we are aware of, but I'm sure a history buff will correct us on this.</p>

            <p>Grave robbing might seem like an idea from a Bram Stoker novel, but back in the 18th century it was a remarkably common activity contributed towards the evolution of medicine and surgery that we know today.</p>

            <p>Up until 1832 It was only legal for surgeons to carry out anatomies on the bodies of convicted murderers who were hanged for their misdeeds (Albert Pierrepoint was our last hangman, retired in 1956) Nationally and naturally this wasn't enough bodies to satisfy the need of the countries medical experts, who would:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>perform autopsies</li>
                <li>train students</li>
                <li>sell tickets for observers</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Obviously, there was money to be made on both sides, grave-robbing brought body snatchers money and surgeons could go about their business and have income from the students and observers. Also, in those days, bodies weren't buried 6ft under as they are now, so opening a grave and taking a body was fairly straightforward. Being next to the harbour, these nefarious individuals could make good their escape.</p>

            <p>The Anatomy Act of 1832 was introduced, which stated that unclaimed bodies from workhouses could be used for dissection.</p>
