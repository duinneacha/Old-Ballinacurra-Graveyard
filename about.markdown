# About Old Ballinacurra Graveyard

<p>There are many historians more qualified than the author to discuss Ballinacurra Church, now lying in ruins alongside its accompanying graveyard. While none of us witnessed the church in its prime, we’ve all seen it in a state of neglect, overgrown with grass and nettles towering six feet high, making it impossible for people to access the strand. Over the years, dedicated individuals have reclaimed the graveyard from nature several times. Even Cork County Council hired a caretaker for this task. However, despite these efforts, at least one individual complained to a teenager’s parents about their voluntary work in the graveyard, even though a paid caretaker was already assigned to it. </p>

<p>The latest initiative to restore the graveyard began in 2019 when Frankie Devlin requested a small path be cleared for the funeral of the late Victor Laar. Her son, Daragh, took on the task, but what started as a simple path soon expanded to 25% of the graveyard. Word spread, and several locals, including the late Jerry Horgan, stepped in to assist. Thanks to these efforts, the graveyard was restored just in time for the funeral. Sadly, Frankie's life was cut short only a few months later, and heartbreakingly, Jerry fell ill at her funeral and passed away soon after in 2020.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, not everyone supported the clean-up efforts. Despite not being from Ballinacurra, several individuals, including a self-proclaimed historian, a politician, and a local busybody, objected to the restoration work. One even staged a solo protest to halt the project. Objections were filed with the council, leading to an investigation and a memorandum of understanding. The Graveyard Team was cleared of all liabilities, and the accusations were dismissed. Many residents came forward to support the team during the council inspection—a gesture that will always be remembered.</p>

<p>This ultimately led to the formation of a formal committee, chaired by Niamh Leahy, with Deborah Desmond acting as secretary until the restoration work was completed. Unfortunately, the arrival of COVID-19 put all efforts on hold, leaving the team back at square one. Despite changes in personnel, full-time employment, and family commitments, the team continues to work tirelessly—without any cost to the community—for the sake of their ancestors and community, not personal gain.
The current team includes Martin Horgan, Cllr John Buckley, Donal Madden, Maria O’Halloran, and Daragh Devlin. They are always looking for more volunteers, even for something as simple as raking grass. If you're interested in volunteering, please get in touch.</p>

<p>We know that some people possess information about those buried here or whose ashes have been laid to rest. We encourage you to share this knowledge with us, helping to ensure these individuals are remembered. Your contribution could also assist those tracing their ancestry. Over the years, we have sifted through more than 150 years of death notices, searched academic databases, and painstakingly cleared the graveyard by hand, chalking stones to preserve inscriptions. We’ve even organized house cleaning in hopes of finding the historic burial register, though without success.</p>

<p>The information we’ve gathered will be released in three stages. First, a website created by Aidan Dennehy of Carrigtwohill will display the research, death notices, word-of-mouth stories, and inscriptions documented from the gravestones. Second, a map will be created, detailing the locations of graves, headstones, markers, and stones. Lastly, we will release any updates, new evidence, or additional information discovered by the team. Aidan, who comes highly recommended, is an invaluable asset to our efforts.</p>

<p>Lastly, we acknowledge that this work will not be flawless. There may be errors or miscalculations, and we ask for your understanding.

We'll respond as quickly as possible.</p>
