# About Old Ballinacurra Graveyard

<p>The Graveyard has been closed for many years with only rare funerals allowed for those with family plots. Since its closure, it has only seen intermittent cleaning due to budgetary constrictions, old age of appointed county council cleaners, and disputes of responsibility. In 2018 a ceremony of laying the ashes was to be held by the Laar Family in grave H14.</p>

<p>The aforementioned Frankie Devlin of whom this website is dedicated discussed the ceremony with Mrs. Eileen Allen and Mrs. Pat O'Brien where the current status of the graveyard was requested. Frankie's son Daragh was "Volun-told" for this task (This is a case of officially volunteering, whereas, in reality, you're after being told"). The graveyard was in terrible condition, the grass was flowing over the headstones, wild trees were damaging headstones, nettles growing over 6ft in height and an absolute health and safety risk.</p>

<p>The graveyard needed to be cleaned up and made amenable to the elderly. The task took 4 months during May, June, July and August 2018. This included working during the week from 0600hrs-0800hrs before a day's work and 1800-2200hrs after work during the summer months. The weekend shift was 0800hrs-0800hrs at weekends. A committee was established with 5 members and 2 trustees and the task was completed.
Historic Graveyard care and maintenance course were completed by three team members below in Youghal, ongoing care and maintenance work continue with the goal of having the graveyard cleaned to is full potential. Graves Identified and our ancestor's stories told. See the before and after pics our facebook page. </p>
